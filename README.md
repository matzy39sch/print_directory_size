# dir_size
List the directory and file size of the provided path and its subdirectories

python3 dir_size.py

Then add an absolute or relative (from the current directory) path as the path input and you should see an ordered directory/file list like :
calculating...
.gitignore         0Bytes
LICENSE            0Bytes
README.md          0Bytes
dir_size.py        0Bytes
.git        34Kb 562Bytes

total      34Kb 562Bytes

If you don't provide the path you should see current directory's file and directoy sizes.
